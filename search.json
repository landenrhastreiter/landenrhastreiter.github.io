    "title": "Are NFL Running Backs Truly Undervalued?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2023, Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor just one full season removed from being a First-Team All-Pro, decided to not play in the first four games of the season due to a dispute of the value of his contract. Taylor eventually signed the dotted line on a new three-year, 42 million dollar contract, but the damage to the Colts season was already done. Through the first four weeks of the regular season, Indianapolis posted a 2-2 record, losing one game in overtime to the Los Angeles Rams. That proved to be costly, as the Colts finished just one game back of the division winning Houston Texans, as well as the last wild card team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThat begs the question: Are NFL Running Backs Truly Undervalued? Stats will help us determine whether that is the case.\nIn 2012, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson won the Most Valuable Player Award. Safe to say that there were not questions about the value of a good running back then, so our data will begin the year after. To start, we can look at how each tailback has ran for the amount of money they were being paid that season. Of course, the salary cap in the league is ever-changing, so we’ll look at the percent of cap room each running back took up on their respective teams, to get an idea of the true value.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\nrbs &lt;- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSg9Fc3oarJZqnJbq98iavMRJD-bi4T7CLiChMVawOk26FEieJsaFirxrLpzguccTLg5hdevRlHFaTl/pub?gid=1935852139&single=true&output=csv\")\nteams &lt;- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSg9Fc3oarJZqnJbq98iavMRJD-bi4T7CLiChMVawOk26FEieJsaFirxrLpzguccTLg5hdevRlHFaTl/pub?gid=1296879230&single=true&output=csv\")\n\nmillions &lt;- rbs |&gt;\n  mutate(Cap = Team_Cap_Per*100)\n\nplayoffs &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"W\")\n\nchampions &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(SuperBowl == \"W\")\n\nthisyear &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(TeamYear == \"2024 Philadelphia Eagles\")\n\npats &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(TeamYear == \"2014 New England Patriots\")\n\nbeast &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(TeamYear == \"2013 Seattle Seahawks\")\n\nking &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(TeamYear == \"2020 Tennessee Titans\")\n\nminny &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(TeamYear == \"2015 Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nvikings &lt;- millions |&gt;\n  filter(TeamYear == \"2013 Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=millions, aes(x=Yds, y=Cap, size=TD), color=\"lightgrey\", alpha=0.6) + \n  geom_point(data=champions,aes(x=Yds, y=Cap, size=TD), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=thisyear, aes(x=Yds-15, y=Cap, label=TeamYear)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data=beast, aes(x=Yds, y=5.5, label=TeamYear)) + \n  geom_text_repel(data=king, aes(x=Yds, y=Cap, label=TeamYear), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=minny, aes(x=Yds, y=Cap-1, label=TeamYear), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=vikings, aes(x=Yds, y=Cap, label=TeamYear), size=3) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Rushing Yards\", \n    y=\"Percentage of Teams' Total Cap Space\", \n    title=\"The Champions Don't Pay Their Backs\", \n    subtitle=\"Outside of the 2016 Seattle Seahawks, No Team Has Won The Super Bowl While Paying Their Runningbacks Over 1.5 Percent of Their Salary Cap.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Landen Hastreiter\" ) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7.5), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose running backs in blue? Those are the most recent Super Bowl Champions. Last season’s Philadelphia Eagles and Saquon Barkley recorded the highest percentage total cap space taken up by a running back, but nothing compares to the anomoly that was the 2013 Seattle Seahawks.\nHowever, it should be noted that Seattle is widely recognized for having a top 10 defense of all-time, regardless of era. The two Vikings teams at the top are a fallout from the 2012 Adrian Peterson MVP Season. Peterson made an average of $14,000,000 after that season, and his production was never the same. Minnesota would only make the playoffs once, however it should be noted that their defense only allowed the fifth most points in the entire league during that campaign, another sign that paying running backs may not be as valuable as the money they demand.\nAs a matter of fact, we can take a look at just the season alone to determine how running backs can be perceived in the modern era. One way to look at that can be rushing success. Sports Reference defines this stat as staying “ahead of the sticks” meaning gaining 40% of the necessary yards on first down, 60% on second down, and achieving a first down on either third or fourth down. By sorting the teams by this statistic and looking at how they faired in the postseason, while looking at the same percentage of team salary cap we previously graphed, the picture becomes even more clear.\n\n\nCode\ntwentyfour &lt;- rbs |&gt;\n  filter(Year == \"2024\")\n\ntable &lt;- twentyfour |&gt;\n  select(TeamYear, Succ_Per, Team_Cap_Per, Playoff_Result, Player) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Succ_Per))\n\ntable |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TeamYear = \"Team\",\n    Succ_Per = \"Rush Success Rate\",\n    Team_Cap_Per = \"Percentage of Team Cap\",\n    Playoff_Result = \"Playoff Result\",\n    Player = \"Leading Rusher\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Does Success on the Ground Relate To Playoff Success?\",\n    subtitle = \"Just over half of the teams that made the 2024 postseason posted a rushing success rate of above 50%.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Landen Hastreiter  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(Succ_Per, Team_Cap_Per),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamYear == \"2024 Philadelphia Eagles\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamYear == \"2024 New Orleans Saints\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamYear == \"2024 Indianapolis Colts\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamYear == \"2024 Arizona Cardinals\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Success on the Ground Relate To Playoff Success?\n\n\nJust over half of the teams that made the 2024 postseason posted a rushing success rate of above 50%.\n\n\nTeam\nRush Success Rate\nPercentage of Team Cap\nPlayoff Result\nLeading Rusher\n\n\n\n\n2024 Atlanta Falcons\n60.2%\n2.0%\nMissed Playoffs\nBijan Robinson\n\n\n2024 Baltimore Ravens\n58.8%\n2.0%\nLost In Divisional\nDerrick Henry\n\n\n2024 Kansas City Chiefs\n55.5%\n0.3%\nRunner-Up\nKareem Hunt\n\n\n2024 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n55.1%\n0.4%\nLost In Wild Card Game\nBucky Irving\n\n\n2024 Carolina Panthers\n54.8%\n1.4%\nMissed Playoffs\nChuba Hubbard\n\n\n2024 Dallas Cowboys\n53.6%\n0.5%\nMissed Playoffs\nRico Dowdle\n\n\n2024 Detroit Lions\n53.6%\n1.7%\nLost In Divisional\nJahmyr Gibbs\n\n\n2024 Buffalo Bills\n53.1%\n0.6%\nLoss in Conference Championship\nJames Cook\n\n\n2024 Philadelphia Eagles\n52.5%\n1.5%\nSuper Bowl Champions\nSaquon Barkley\n\n\n2024 Cincinnati Bengals\n52.4%\n0.4%\nMissed Playoffs\nChase Brown\n\n\n2024 Green Bay Packers\n52.2%\n2.1%\nLost In Wild Card Game\nJosh Jacobs\n\n\n2024 Arizona Cardinals\n51.7%\n4.4%\nMissed Playoffs\nJames Conner\n\n\n2024 New Orleans Saints\n51.3%\n6.3%\nMissed Playoffs\nAlvin Kamara\n\n\n2024 Los Angeles Rams\n50.9%\n0.4%\nLost In Divisional\nKyren Williams\n\n\n2024 New England Patriots\n50.2%\n2.1%\nMissed Playoffs\nRhamondre Stevenson\n\n\n2024 Minnesota Vikings\n49.8%\n1.4%\nLost In Wild Card Game\nAaron Jones\n\n\n2024 Jacksonville Jaguars\n49.4%\n0.5%\nMissed Playoffs\nTank Bigsby\n\n\n2024 Miami Dolphins\n49.3%\n0.5%\nMissed Playoffs\nDe'Von Achane\n\n\n2024 Washington Commanders\n48.7%\n0.6%\nLoss in Conference Championship\nBrian Robinson Jr.\n\n\n2024 Tennessee Titans\n47.7%\n1.6%\nMissed Playoffs\nTony Pollard\n\n\n2024 Cleveland Browns\n47.1%\n0.4%\nMissed Playoffs\nJerome Ford\n\n\n2024 San Francisco 49ers\n47.1%\n0.4%\nMissed Playoffs\nJordan Mason\n\n\n2024 Denver Broncos\n46.8%\n1.1%\nLost In Wild Card Game\nJavonte Williams\n\n\n2024 New York Jets\n46.4%\n1.0%\nMissed Playoffs\nBreece Hall\n\n\n2024 Indianapolis Colts\n45.9%\n4.3%\nMissed Playoffs\nJonathan Taylor\n\n\n2024 Seattle Seahawks\n44.4%\n0.9%\nMissed Playoffs\nKenneth Walker III\n\n\n2024 New York Giants\n44.3%\n0.3%\nMissed Playoffs\nTyrone Tracy Jr.\n\n\n2024 Chicago Bears\n43.9%\n2.3%\nMissed Playoffs\nD'Andre Swift\n\n\n2024 PIttsburgh Steelers\n43.7%\n1.7%\nLost In Wild Card Game\nNajee Harris\n\n\n2024 Los Angeles Chargers\n42.6%\n0.4%\nLost In Wild Card Game\nJ.K.

These three teams were the only ones to pay their running backs over four percent of the team’s total salary, but none of them found themselves in the postseason. Whereas the Kansas City Chiefs and Kareem Hunt, who only costed the Chiefs $820,833 against their salary cap, made the Super Bowl, while Hunt rushed at a success rate of 55.5%, good enough for third in the NFL.\nTurning away from just this most recent season, we can also take a look at the teams who ended the season reigning as champions, determining if the ultimate goal of every NFL franchise, every single season, is fulfilled in part by having an efficent running back.\n\n\nCode\nbig &lt;- teams |&gt;\n  filter(SuperBowl == \"W\")\n\nrush &lt;- big |&gt;\n  select(Year, TeamYear, Yards_Rushing, Yards_Passing, TotalYards)\n\nteamlong &lt;- rush |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Yards\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Yards\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=teamlong, aes(x=reorder(TeamYear, Year), weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"grey\",\n    \"blue\"\n  ))+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Super Bowl Winning Team\", \n    y=\"Total Yards\", \n    title=\"Last Year's Eagles Run Better Than Any Recent Super Bowl Winner\", \n    subtitle=\"The 2024 Philadelphia Eagles are the only Champion since 2012 to eclipse 3000 Yards on the Ground.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Landen Hastreiter\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, the reigning Super Bowl Champions appear to be an anomaly in terms of running back success leading to team success, and once again in large part to the breakthrough of Saquon Barkley. Another reason for this could be that many of the quarterbacks on this list are widely considered to be the greatest of all-time, or at least the greatest in their era. Field generals such as Peyton Manning, Patrick Mahomes, and the most notable, Tom Brady appears on the list four times (2014, 2016, 2018, 2020). When you have quarterbacks of that caliber, a coach’s first instinct is to put the ball in his hands.\nBut of course, when looking at statistics, a few other specifics jump out immediately. In 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the almighty Tom Brady in the Super Bowl, having backup quarterback Nick Foles under center the entirety of that contest. Philadelphia used a pair of backers in that game, LaGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi, who costed the Eagles just 1.6 million against their salary cap. Darren Sproles, who was supposed to be the lead back the entire season, suffered a gruesome injury just three weeks into the season. For reference, the backfield duo costed the champions less than the Chicago Bears are paying third-string running back Travis Homer during the 2025-26 season. Yet another point towards winning while saving on ball carriers.\nBut, just like any professional sport, coaches have different strategies as to how they want to run their offense. So how does this fair from team to team? From running back to running back? To get a good glimpse of this, we can take a look at the recent seasons of the Denver Broncos.\n\n\nCode\nden &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Denver Broncos\")\nkc &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\nlac &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Chargers\")\nlv &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Las Vegas Raiders\")\nbuf &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Buffalo Bills\")\nne &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"New England Patriots\")\nmia &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Miami Dolphins\")\nnyj &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"New York Jets\")\ncin &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Cincinnati Bengals\")\ncle &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Cleveland Browns\")\npit &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\nbal &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Baltimore Ravens\")\nind &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indianapolis Colts\")\nhou &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Houston Texans\")\nten &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tennessee Titans\")\njax &lt;- rbs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Jacksonville Jaguars\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=pit, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=kc, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=lac, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n   geom_line(data=lv, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=buf, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=ne, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") +\n   geom_line(data=mia, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=nyj, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=ind, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") +\n   geom_line(data=hou, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=ten, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=jax, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") +\n   geom_line(data=cle, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=cin, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") + \n    geom_line(data=bal, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"#e3e3e3\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2022) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020) +\n  geom_line(data=den, aes(x=Year, y=Conf_Seed), color=\"blue\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2018, 2025)) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"AFC Finishing Position\", \n    title=\"Broncos Benefit From Saving on Runningbacks\", \n    subtitle=\"With Javonte Williams Making Only One Third of The Contract Melvin Gordon Did, Denver has surged to the top of the AFC.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Landen Hastreiter\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022.6, y=4, label=\"Broncos Start\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022.725, y=5, label=\"Javonte Williams\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2022.5, y=6, label=\"($2.6M/Year)\"), size = 3, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.60001, y=4, label=\"Broncos Sign\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.65, y=5, label=\"Melvin Gordon\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2020.5, y=6, label=\"($7.9M/Year)\"), size = 3, color=\"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring consecutive 2018 and 2019 campaigns, Phillip Lindsay posted 1000 yard seasons and looked like the future of the Broncos backfield. However, during the following season, Lindsay suffered a multitude of injuries from turf toe to concussions, forcing Denver to pivot at the running back position. They turned to backup Melvin Gordon, who they had given a 16 million dollar contract over two years, costing them an average of 7.9 million towards their salary cap. During Gordon’s time in the Mile High city, he could never recreate Lindsay’s production. While being a serviceable back for two seasons, his production never led to team success, as the Broncos failed to improve in the AFC standings in any year that Gordon was the workhorse. In 2022, it all fell apart, as Gordon fumbled five times in just 90 carries over 10 games, an average of 18 carries before the ball was put in harms way. Because of this, Gordon was ultimately released by the Broncos before the season’s end in December 2022.\nAfter the collapse of Gordon, Denver turned to second year backup Javonte Williams. Williams, much like Melvin Gordon, never produced the yardage that Phillip Lindsay did, but his impact was monumental in the Broncos rise in the AFC playoff picture, only fumbling three times in his two years as the starter. More importantly, Williams only costed Denver 2.6 million dollars per year, aiding the 2025 AFC West division leaders to bolster their defense, which is regarded as the best in the NFL today.\nSo with that being said, Are NFL Running Backs Truly Undervalued? Statistics and history point to team success being built around saving at the running back position and bolstering other offensive weapons to truly create a well rounded team. However, for some teams, and more importantly some coach’s philosophies, a good running back can be the center of an offense that finds themselves in prime position to make a deep playoff run."

    "title": "Were the 2025 Cleveland Guardians The Luckiest Division Winners Ever?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Cleveland Guardians shocked the baseball world last season, coming from 15.5 games down in mid-July to win the American League Central, a deficit that had never been overcome in the history of Major League Baseball. They finished the month of September with a 20-7 record, surpassing the Detroit Tigers during the final week of the season.\nBut even with this amazing end to the season, the Guardians only won their division by a single game. With Detroit being the final team to make the playoffs due to their tiebreaker win over the Astros, which the Guardians also held, Cleveland only made the playoffs by two games. This begs the question: In a game in which so much can be decided on one pitch or one swing, did the Guardians just simply get lucky?\nAnd thus, how lucky were they? Were they possibly the luckiest division winner ever?\nLet’s look at the stats to determine just that.\nSports Reference’s Major League Baseball site creates a statistical “Luck” value. Sports Reference takes a team’s run differential and determines what their record should be, and compares it to what their record actually was. Essentially, this gives a good view of how lucky or unlucky a team was.\nFinding the luckiest division winner since Major League Baseball was founded in 1876 is nearly impossible, due to teams switching divisions and even, at some points, uneven number of teams per division. The last change in divisions came between the 2012 and 2013 seasons, when the Houston Astros left the National League Central to join the American League West.\nThis left five teams in each division, so we will start there (excluding 2020, due to COVID shortening the season).\nClearly, the first question to ask is, which division winners benefitted the most from Luck? Here are the top 20 luckiest division winners.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQmpETjsJGA8mrzSp03UJFBBCrsZeXvSTDI7_tY112Kh9ITTWOzmlA_DjPnK6PjADe_uYD6S5wLmzJS/pub?gid=1937133345&single=true&output=csv\")\n\ncovid &lt;- mlb |&gt; filter(Year &gt;2020 | Year &lt;2020)\n\ndivisionwinners &lt;- covid |&gt; filter(DivisionRank == \"1\")\n\nluckiestteams &lt;- divisionwinners |&gt;\n  top_n(20, wt=Luck)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=luckiestteams, \n    aes(y=reorder(TeamSzn, -pythW), x=W, xend=pythW),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Expected Wins vs Total Wins\", \n    y=\"Division Winner Season\", \n    title=\"Number of Wins vs Expected Wins Amongst Division Winners\", \n    subtitle = \"The longer the difference between a teams' &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Expected Wins&lt;/span&gt; and their &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Total Wins&lt;/span&gt; , the luckier they were\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Landen Hastreiter\"\n  ) + \n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleveland may not have the most Luck in a single season by a division winner, but they are the division winner with the lowest expected wins, the only team who was expected to finish under .500.\nBut to be a good team, you have to compete with other good teams. So how does Cleveland stack up there?\n\n\nCode\ncleveland &lt;- divisionwinners |&gt;\n  filter(TeamSzn == \"2025 Cleveland Guardians\")\n\ngoodteams &lt;- divisionwinners |&gt;\n  filter(`Win%≥.500` &gt; 0.63)\n\nbadteams &lt;- divisionwinners |&gt;\n  filter(`Win%≥.500` &lt; 0.45)\n\n\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=divisionwinners, aes(x=`Win%≥.500`, y=`Win%&lt;.500`), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_point(data=cleveland, aes(x=`Win%≥.500`, y=`Win%&lt;.500`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=goodteams, aes(x=`Win%≥.500`, y=`Win%&lt;.500`), color=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = cleveland,aes(x = 0.485, y = (`Win%&lt;.500`+0.0074), label = TeamSzn), size=3, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = goodteams,aes(x = `Win%≥.500`, y = `Win%&lt;.500`, label = TeamSzn), size=1.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = badteams,aes(x = `Win%≥.500`, y = `Win%&lt;.500`, label = TeamSzn), size=1.5) +\n      labs(\n    x=\"Win% Percentage Against Teams Above .500\", \n    y=\"Win% Against Teams Under .500\", \n    title=\"Guardians Seem to Struggle Against Good Teams\", \n    subtitle = \"Cleveland is one of only twelve division winners in the current format to finish under .500 against teams that ended over .500\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Landen Hastreiter\"\n  ) + \n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleveland doesn’t have the worst win percentage against teams at .500 or better, but they are absolutely in the bottom 10. This could be due to a lack of games against good teams. But how would we know who has played more good teams than their peers? A win against a 2-0 team in March that ends up with a record 60-102 counts towards the win percentage, but that team isn’t considered “good”.\nOne way to look at how many quality opponents a team faces in a given season, a start would be looking at how the MLB creates their schedule, and how many times each team plays each other. The most games for each team are against their division, with 52 of the 162 total games being played against the other four teams, 13 each.\nAs a result of this, we can take a look at the winning percentage of the teams in each division that didn’t finish first. We eliminate the division winners from this data because if a team wins their division by large number of games, their winning percentage can inflate the division’s win percentage as a whole. Here are the bottom 20 division winning percentages in our time frame.\n\n\nCode\ndivisionstats &lt;- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQmpETjsJGA8mrzSp03UJFBBCrsZeXvSTDI7_tY112Kh9ITTWOzmlA_DjPnK6PjADe_uYD6S5wLmzJS/pub?gid=1915124800&single=true&output=csv\")\n\n\ntopdivisions &lt;- divisionstats |&gt;\n  top_n(20, wt=(-DivisionWinLoss))\n\ncentral &lt;- topdivisions |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Division == \"2025 AL Central\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topdivisions, aes(x=reorder(Division, DivisionWinLoss), weight=DivisionWinLoss)) + \n  geom_bar(data=central, aes(x=reorder(Division, DivisionWinLoss), weight=DivisionWinLoss), fill=\"red\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Division Season\", \n    y=\"Division Winning Percentage\", \n    title=\"Worst Winning Percentage by Division\", \n    subtitle = \"Cleveland was victorious over the worst division by winnning percentage in the modern era, but this years' NL West also makes an appearance\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Landen Hastreiter\"\n  ) + \n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size = 6),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 American League Central and 2016 National League West are tied for the worst division winning percentage of the last 13 years. It isn’t surprising that this is the case, as only one other team from the Central finished above .500, and that team finished just a single game back of the Guardians. But it does raise another question: Was it just luck that willed Cleveland to a division win?\nTo determine this, we can first look at the team hitting stats from this last season. A team that absolutely crushes the baseball can afford to be a weaker pitching team.\nTwo common baseball stats that Sports Reference uses are On-Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage. If you add these two values together, you get On-Base Plus Slugging, or OPS.\nAnother stat used is OPS+. OPS+ shows how good a team’s OPS was against league average. It is measured with a base of 100 being exactly league average. Anything more than 100 is above average, and subsequently anything less than 100 is below league average.\nTo determine how good Cleveland was last year at the plate, we can take a look at each team’s OPS, and OPS+ from 2025.\n\n\nCode\nthisseason &lt;- mlb |&gt;\n  filter(Year == \"2025\")\n\nteamops &lt;- thisseason |&gt;\n  select(TeamSzn, OPS, `OPS+`) |&gt;\n  arrange((OPS))\nteamops |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(OPS = \"OPS\", `OPS+` = \"OPS+\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Did The Guardians Hit Their Way To A Title?\",\n    subtitle = \"Cleveland posted the second worst batting average across baseball last season\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Landen Hastreiter  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamSzn == \"2025 Cleveland Guardians\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid The Guardians Hit Their Way To A Title?\n\n\nCleveland posted the second worst batting average across baseball last season\n\n\nTeamSzn\nOPS\nOPS+\n\n\n\n\n2025 Pittsburgh Pirates\n0.655\n82\n\n\n2025 Cleveland Guardians\n0.670\n85\n\n\n2025 Chicago White Sox\n0.675\n88\n\n\n2025 Colorado Rockies\n0.679\n80\n\n\n2025 Texas Rangers\n0.684\n100\n\n\n2025 St. Louis Cardinals\n0.693\n96\n\n\n2025 Washington Nationals\n0.693\n96\n\n\n2025 Los Angeles Angels\n0.695\n91\n\n\n2025 San Francisco Giants\n0.697\n99\n\n\n2025 Baltimore Orioles\n0.699\n96\n\n\n2025 Cincinnati Reds\n0.706\n90\n\n\n2025 Kansas City Royals\n0.706\n96\n\n\n2025 Miami Marlins\n0.708\n95\n\n\n2025 Minnesota Twins\n0.708\n94\n\n\n2025 San Diego Padres\n0.711\n96\n\n\n2025 Houston Astros\n0.714\n97\n\n\n2025 Tampa Bay Rays\n0.714\n99\n\n\n2025 Atlanta Braves\n0.720\n102\n\n\n2025 Detroit Tigers\n0.730\n101\n\n\n2025 Milwaukee Brewers\n0.736\n105\n\n\n2025 Seattle Mariners\n0.740\n113\n\n\n2025 Boston Red Sox\n0.745\n106\n\n\n2025 Athletics\n0.749\n106\n\n\n2025 Chicago Cubs\n0.751\n116\n\n\n2025 New York Mets\n0.753\n113\n\n\n2025 Arizona Diamondbacks\n0.757\n108\n\n\n2025 Philadelphia Phillies\n0.759\n106\n\n\n2025 Toronto Blue Jays\n0.761\n108\n\n\n2025 Los Angeles Dodgers\n0.768\n114\n\n\n2025 New York Yankees\n0.787\n118\n\n\n\nBy: Landen Hastreiter | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing 29th out of 30 in total OPS and 28th in OPS+, it is clear that Cleveland wasn’t getting their production done at the plate. That doesn’t mean it was just sheer will and luck that got the Guardians to the top of the AL Central. We can also look at pitching stats to determine if their defending was the reason for their success.\nWith each team having five to six starting pitchers on roster that begin games on the mound during a given week, that would be a good place to start.\nSo what about looking at those starting pitchers?

Statistics point to them absolutely having a case, but you cannot ignore the brilliant consistency on the mound."
